# Demo UI of distributing data 

This directory contains your Application Views and Routes.
The framework reads all the `*.vue` files inside this directory and creates the router of your application.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/routing).

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
